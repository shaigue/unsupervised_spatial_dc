# This is the README.md for the CS236605 course final project

This should have the parts:

1. explain the code structure inside of src/
  - explain each module, and each section

2. explain on how to reproduce the experiment, step by step
  - where to put the data
  - what configurations to change
  - how to do the preprocessing
  - how to run the experiment 

<probably just copy the README.md of the git repository of the project here>

# in the same main submition directory we should have src/ folder with all of the code
## and the .pdf + .word containing the work report
