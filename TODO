TODO:
1. the input audio needs to be of a floating point format
2. needs to be reduced to only one channel pre-mixing
3. to down sample the samples, 44.1kHz is too much
4. In the current data set, if the we loose the modulu of the batch if it does not devide exactly(0 batches problem)



Flow:
1. samples need to be preprocessed - 
    float
    mono-channel
    low sample rate
    cut into small samples
2. need to be formated as the data, and with meta data
3. mic samples need to be created with the correct phase delays

For Improvement:
1. use beamforming for estimating the signal, not only masking
2. use more sufisticated clustering (spectralNet) for clustering rather then K-means
3. use a more efficeint method to mix the signals
4. Add your own 'label inferance' based on the wanted algorithem / signal properties
5.
